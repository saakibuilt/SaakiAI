## Common Issues

### I’m not receiving login or password reset emails
- Check spam/junk folders
- Search for **[App Name]** in your inbox
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- If using an iCloud/Apple private relay address, verify delivery settings

### App is slow or freezing
- Force close and reopen the app
- Update to the latest version of iOS and **[App Name]**
- Restart your device
- Ensure you have a stable connection (Wi-Fi or cellular)

### My analysis results look off
AI analysis depends on the clarity of chart images and the data available.
Try:

- Avoiding cropped images that cut off candles, indicators, or axis labels
